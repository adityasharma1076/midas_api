This repository contains all code for the paper on ["MIDAS: Mental Illness Detection and Analysis via Social media"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7752434). 

We also built an [API](https://github.com/omarsar/DeepViz) that is able to provide real-time machine learning inferences from social media accounts.
